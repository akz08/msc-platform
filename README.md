Cerebral Palsy Scooter Platform
==================================================================

About
-----
Prototype code used for a Master's dissertation for the creation of a rehabilitation system for children with motor disability. The code consists of two main components:

* [Sensor & data visualisation UI][1] using [OpenFrameworks][3]

* [Base implementation of vision-based foot detection methods][6] using [OpenCV] [2]  

As the repository was created primarily as a backup tool, and this was a *learn-as-you-go project*, there are plenty of obsolete files and several clones of [OpenFrameworks][3] project files. The bulk of the self-authored working code can be found at the linked bullet points above. A basic game using [OSC][4] for networking with the sensor UI was also created in C#/[Unity3D][5], but was not uploaded due to size constraints.

**This repository is for reference purposes only.**

Development
-----------
Development of the project will be continued in a separate repository, after sufficient revision of programming concepts in C++. The current target is full reimplementation of the system using the Qt framework, with a completion date of early 2014.
